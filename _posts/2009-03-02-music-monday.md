I'm going to try to make this a regular item on my blog in an attempt to post more.  Here's a video from Bob Sinclair off one of his more recent albums.    I've always loved this song.  I first discovered Bob Sinclair about 10 years ago on the Respect is Burning compilations and his Champs Elysees album.  He keeps putting out new music and while I haven't picked up an album of his in recent years, I always check out his new tunes.
