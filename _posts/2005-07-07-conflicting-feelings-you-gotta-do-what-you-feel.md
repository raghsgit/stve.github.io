My thoughts and prayers are with those in London.

It's a day of conflicting feelings for me today. After brimming with postivity and good feeling last night, waking up to the terrorist attacks was a rude awakening to say the least. I think every one of us probably relived September 11th, even if just for a few minutes, at some time today. I know I did.

Last night we went to the 930 club again, this time to see the Digable Planets. The show was nothing short of spectacular. After 9 years apart, they sounded like they hadn't skipped a beat. What's more, they promised to go into the studio after they finished their tour to record a new album.

Their music is just brimming with positivity and it really put me on a natural high last night. You gotta do what ya feel...
