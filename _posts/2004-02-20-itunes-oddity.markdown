Having just gotten an iPod for my birthday, I've been tooling around in iTunes quite a bit.  I'm really impressed by the interface, it's top notch.  And overall i've found it really easy to use.  Today was my first day buying music and I've run into a stumbling block.  There are often times multiple versions of songs available.  But iTunes only lets you listen to about 30 seconds of each song.  So I bought 'Poison' by Bell Biv Devoe and lo and behold, there's about 45 seconds of lead in that I don't want.  I didn't want the extended version.  So I've written iTunes a message, we'll see how it goes.

<hr class="hide" />Here's my letter, we'll see where this goes:<em>Dear iTunes Music Store,</em>

<em>On 2/20/2004 I purchased Poison by Bell Biv Devoe.  I inadvertently purchased the extended version of this song.  Since I was only able to listen to a 30 second preview, I had no way of knowing that this was the extended version when I made the purchase.  I'd like to exchange the download I purchased for the non-extended version.  Please assist me as I do not know how to proceed and I don't feel I should have to pay for another download.</em>

<em>Sincerely,
Steve Agalloco</em>
