I almost didn't give blood today.  I've never given blood before and was pretty uneasy about it.  Ever since high school when I was first exposed to blood drives, I have avoided them.  I don't really like anything having to do with vials, needles, rubber gloves, etc.

But today I was brave, I read the info, then nervously walked onto the bus.  I got as far as giving them all my info and a blood sample from my finger, when the nurse asked, have you eaten?  Since I had not, she sent me off for some lunch.  Relieved by the fact that I had escaped with only the tiniest band aid on my middle finger, I headed off to "run a few errands" and grab some lunch.  I comforted myself with the thought that they'd be too busy when I returned.

But after 45 minutes, my time was up.  I was back on the bus, anxiously grinding my teeth and observing every movement by the nurses.  Finally it was my turn.  It really wasn't that bad, my technician was friendly.  The poor guy next to me, after having been stuck about three or four times in his left arm, wasn't filling his bag so they tapped his right and finished it off.  That didn't really seem all that fair to me, but I guess the Red Cross is determined to get all it can out of you.

The whole ordeal was over rather quickly.  I sat there drinking my apple cranberry juice and munching on animal crackers for about 10 minutes afterwards.  I felt fine so I got up and headed back to my desk.  And then it hit me.  The room got really dim and grey, I got up and walked to the cubicle next to mine.  Tracy, the one who had convinced me to donate blood in the first place, was not there.  So I returned to my cube and lay down on the floor with my feet up.  It passed, I got up, then laid back down.  For about 10 minutes I just sat in my desk chair.  Friends were saying drink water, eat a candy bar.  I was too full to eat and too dizzy to get water. Had I been able to drive, I would have gone home.

Finally I felt better and got some skittles.  Those skittles saved me.  I've felt better ever since.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.receptivefield.com">Christian</a> and <a href="http://www.lelandphoto.com/">James</a> for the encouragement.  And thanks M&M/Mars for making the sweetest candy!

It feels great to have donated.  I hope my blood can help save a life.  But as sick as I felt afterwards, I'm not really sure it's something I would do again.
