It's funny how your brain associates disparate subjects. Certain songs remind me of certain things, that's par for the course for most people. For me, the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction is entirely ruined for me by that scene in <a title="awful movie" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0282687/">Life or Something Like It</a> where the character played by Angelina Jolie is a reporter covering a worker strike. She is there to do a report on the strike but instead feels moved to stir things up. What ensues is a corny singalong where all of the workers start singing Satisfaction along with her.

Thank you Angelina Jolie and whoever wrote that awful movie. Because now, whenver I hear that song, I think of your stupid film.
