Dwele's tribute to Dilla is short but I really love the beat here.  It's cool to hear all these classic Dilla tunes combined together.  He's been gone over 3 years now and still making an impact.  Also one to keep on the lookout for is the upcoming release <a href="http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.8717/title.j-dilla-s-mother-pete-rock-to-release-posthumous-dilla-album">Jay Stay Paid</a>.
