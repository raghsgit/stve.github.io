title: Woot, RSS, Streams and Twitter
---

Last week there was a [woot-off](http://woot.com).  While I've only purchased something from Woot once or times before, the woot-offs are really cool because you never know what they might put up there.  I decided it'd be a fun side project to right a little script to post the latest woot to Campfire and the script was [trivially simple](http://gist.github.com/590089) to write.  [Tinder](http://tinder.rubyforge.org/) makes it really easy to interact with Campfire so I just had to figure out a way to get the current Woot.  I used woot's RSS feed to give me this data.  It was pretty easy: fetch the feed, parse it, loop through the entries and find the first item in the 'woot' category, a little more parsing and voila.  I had it.

(I realized after the fact that woot already has a twitter account strictly for wootoffs, but it was far from complete enough to replace what I'd built.  For starters, I would have had to parse the text of the tweet and even then, it didn't include a direct link to the product or a link to an image.)

What dawned on me was what a poor job RSS does for this sort of thing.  I had to continually poll (every 30 seconds) to see if anything had been updated, at some points nothing changed for nearly an hour.  I see why technologies like pubsubhubbub and rssCloud are a potential replacements.  But why haven't they taken off?  Well, for one, the name pubsubhubbub is a little obtuse, but moreso, it just seems a little complicated.  When you have to create a [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5kHx0rGkec) to explain your technology in overly simplified terms like the pubsubhubbub team did, you aren't off to all that great of a start.  Wordpress adopted rssCloud but has it made any difference?  We're over a year in and neither technology seems to have taken hold in any significant way.

Not foreign to continual polling, Twitter took a different approach, introducing a [streaming api](http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api).  I can't help but think this is a much easier and more dynamic means of delivery.  But who wants to consume a bunch of different streams?  Well, pretty soon, we may not have to.  Twitter has also been working on [annotations](http://dev.twitter.com/pages/annotations_overview).  Woot could simply annotate their tweets and anyone writing a service around it just subscribes to the stream.  Awesome.  Twitter annotations is an amazingly powerful idea wrapped up in the simplicity of their **service** and I can't wait to see what people do with it.
