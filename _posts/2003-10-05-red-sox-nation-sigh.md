The city is charged up by the Red Sox right now.  They adore their beloved Red Sox.  Last night's extra-inning win really got things going.  Immediately, the bartenders knew it was going to be a busy night.  As soon as the winning home run was hit, the bar we were at just erupted. I just sat in my chair.

It can be pretty lonely being a Yankees fan in the Boston area.  I keep joking with Christine that I'm going to head out with my Yankees cap on.  But of course, I'm only joking.  Wearing a Yankees hat in Boston is grounds for abuse.  Instead, my Jeter shirt and Yankees cap sit in my closet, never to be worn.

I do think, however, that the rivalry between the Yankees and the Sox is played up.  Sure there are the "Yankees Suck" chants in Fenway, and the 1918 Hats they sell near Yankees Stadium.  But there is a mutual respect for the opposing team that most intelligent fans will acknowledge.

But while I listen to Nomar this, Manny that. I quietly relish in every Red Sox loss.
