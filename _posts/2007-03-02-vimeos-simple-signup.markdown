I love the simplicity of <a href="http://www.vimeo.com" title="vimeo">vimeo's</a> signup screen.  It's no frills.  No password confirmation, no ajax to tell me if my username is available or not (i find that annoying).  The only curious thing is the gender question, but it's not like they're asking for all that much information.  Click finish and you're done, "takes like 10 seconds" as they say on their homepage.

What frustrates me about webapps these days is the proliferation of similar features.  <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2006/1218_network_once.php" title="Network Once, Socialize Anywhere">Khoi Vinh</a>  pointed out that every app contains it's own social network.  Why stop there?  Why can't common information like my blog url, email address, phone number (for sms), bio, etc. all be controlled from a single location.  Sort of like an <a href="http://openid.net/" title="OpenID">OpenID</a> for everything else.  This is what Tom Coates was talking about in his <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/files/native/" title="Native to a Web of Data">Native to a Web of Data</a> presentation, pushing beyond display and pages.
