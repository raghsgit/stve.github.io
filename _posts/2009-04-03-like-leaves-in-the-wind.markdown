I swear one day I'll post something other than youtube videos here but for the time being, it's better than nothing.  I have actually been toying with redesigning this site while i'm at it, possibly using <a href="http://aaronweyenberg.com/">Aaron's</a> Green Tea theme.

In the meantime, I had to share this video of song of <a href="http://www.nicolaconte.it/">Nicola Conte's</a> new album Rituals.  My copy finally arrived from Japan the other day and it's simply a magical album.  I'm a big fan of Nicola Conte and love the fact that he's from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari">Bari</a> where much of my family comes from.
