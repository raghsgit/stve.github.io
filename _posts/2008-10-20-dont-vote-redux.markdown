That was a pretty <a href="http://coolspotters.com/actors/forrest-whitaker/and/nonprofits/declare-yourself">impressive list of celebrities</a> that decided to participate in the <a href="http://www.beforeitwasround.com/2008/10/20/dont-vote/">Don't Vote video that I posted yesterday</a>.  But I have to wonder about the tone.  Are America's youth really that cynical?  They have to be talked down to in such a low level to be compelled to vote?

I plan on voting.  Hopefully you are too.  And if you haven't done so yet, it's not too late to <a href="http://maps.google.com/vote">register</a>.
