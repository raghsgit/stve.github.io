I found this article on <a title="peterme" href="http://www.peterme.com">Peter's site</a>: <a title=" On the Record: Chip Conley" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/07/BUGSFE1OF51.DTL"> On the Record: Chip Conley</a>

It contained this notable quote: <em>"I still don't rank all that high, but it's all about how you define success in life, and for me at that point in my life, and still today, my definition of success is very much based on how much joie de vivre there is in my life and in other people's lives."</em>

There just don't seem to be enough voices like this in business.
