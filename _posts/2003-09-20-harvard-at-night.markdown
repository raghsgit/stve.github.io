I've been quiet lately.  Mostly because I've been busy enjoying the last nights of summer.  Tomorrow is officially the last day of summer, but we've already gotten a taste of fall up here.  The nights are cool and crisp, the days are still beautiful and perfect.  I'm happy that fall is here, but I know that with it will come the cold air and eventually the snow.
