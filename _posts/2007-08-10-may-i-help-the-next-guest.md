title: May I Help The Next Guest?

Twice in the past week, I've heard an employee ask this exact question.  Once in the concessions line at AMC Theaters, and once in line at Panera.  I eat at Panera a few times a month and I've never heard them call me a "guest" before.  I've always been a "customer."  It's interesting though that two different vendors are addressing their customers this way.  And I find it a little odd.

Am I really their guest?  In each instance, I've spent money to be on the premises.  Not that there was a fee for entry, but nevertheless, I'm there not to be their guest, but to accomplish something else.  At AMC, to enjoy a movie.  At Panera, to get some lunch.  I wonder if they believe that by calling me a guest vs. a customer, they are being more humane.  That I might feel more welcome as a guest.  That I'm privileged to be there.  That they are my host.  That's an interesting thought.  Being a host means being gracious, being hospitable, being generous, etc.  And that's where the guest treatment ends for me.

Panera's always been a bit warmer environment than, say Burger King or McDonalds.  It offers free wifi, a few cozy chairs.  But it hasn't really changed anything else.  AMC still charges an obscene amount for soda and popcorn. And the floor is still sticky. And my chair still gets kicked by the person behind me.

Am I happy being their customer?  I guess.  But being their guest?  Not unless they really mean it.
