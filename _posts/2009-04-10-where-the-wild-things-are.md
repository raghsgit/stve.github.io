By now you've probably seen this already, but I had to put it up here.  I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to this movie.  We were at Barnes & Noble over the weekend buying some new books for the little one and I was really tempted to buy the book.  We didn't pick up the book because it's not quite appropriate for 11 month olds that just want to put things in their mouth, but I hope one day this becomes a favorite.  It's certainly one of mine.

While not normally something I'd listen to, the song in the trailer fits really well and is a beautifully flowing song.  In case you want to know more about the song, it's <a href="http://coolspotters.com/songs/wake-up/and/movies/where-the-wild-things-are#medium-51403">Wake Up by Arcade Fire</a>.
