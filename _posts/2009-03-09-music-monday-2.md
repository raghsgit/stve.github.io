<a href="http://www.little-dragon.se/">Little Dragon</a> is a project of Swedish vocalist <a href="http://www.myspace.com/68763249">Yukimi Nagano</a>.  I first found out about Yukimi through the music of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/koop">Koop</a> whose albums I am a huge fan of.

The song in this video is Think Twice.  I recently heard it during an episode of <a href="http://coolspotters.com/tv-shows/greys-anatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a> (embarrassing disclosure: yes, I watch Grey's Anatomy, my wife likes it, and in turn I watch plenty of Yankees games during baseball season).  It took me a minute to figure out what was playing and I was really happy to hear it once I recognized the song.  Fans of <a href="http://coolspotters.com/musicians/adele">Adele</a> and the like, you should definitely check out Little Dragon.
