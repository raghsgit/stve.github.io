I'm announcing my pseudopodcast: heavy rotation.  I love music and love sharing it with others.  A few times a week I'll feature the music I have been digging.  Some old, some new.  I have fairly eclectic tastes.  Expect to hear a lot of brokenbeat, nujazz, some electronic and some hip-hop.  I hope you enjoy it.

Update 10/27: Ok, so the whole podcast thing didn't take off like I originally planned.  I stopped updating it in May and soon after, the only real purpose it served was for Japanese blogs to link directly to the mp3's.  Experiment over.
