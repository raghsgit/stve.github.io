I had some free time the other day so I slapped together a bot that polls ESPN's primary RSS feed and sends updates over to Twitter.  You can check it out at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/espn" title="twitter.com/espn">twitter.com/espn</a>.  It's not without it's hiccups and please note that it is completely unofficial.  I don't work for ESPN and I didn't ask their permission so this is 100% beta and i'll probably end up turning it over to them eventually anyway.  I can't imagine they'd not want to support this themselves at some point in the not too distant future.

I was surprised at how easy it was to do this.  I decided to use ruby and it proved up to the task.  I was very surprised at how easy it was to learn ruby.  I'd never coded anything in ruby before, and haven't done nearly as much coding lately as I have in the past so this was a fun exercise.  28 lines of code and a single database table and voila!

If you want to receive my personal updates, you can <a href="http://www.twitter.com/anno" title="twitter.com/anno">access them</a> too.
