Something I've seen on a <a href="http://gemcutter.org">few</a> <a href="http://animoto.com">sites</a> lately is really large textboxes on signup/sign in forms.  I'm not sure how I feel about them.  In most cases, sites have used this fairly effectively with only a few fields requiring entry.  But when I'm on my 13" Macbook Pro, I have to scroll to see the submit button at the bottom.

The other thing that large textboxes does is eliminate other possibilities for these pages, like <a href="http://bokardo.com/archives/using-your-sign-up-form-as-a-qualifier/">using the sign up form as a qualifier</a>.  <a href="http://bokardo.com">Joshua Porter</a>, the author of that article also recently gave a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bokardo/designing-for-social-traction">presentation</a> that has really inspired me lately.  Highly recommended.
