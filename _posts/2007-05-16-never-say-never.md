"I'll never do..." I find myself saying this a lot.  Here's a few of those things I've claimed I'll never do:

<ul>
	<li>Put a bumper sticker that says "My child and my money go to XYZ College."  Ditto for a bumper sticker that says "Proud parent of an honor roll student at XYZ Middle School."  Actually, I think this could just be a blanket rule, no bumper stickers, but these are particularly tacky.</li>
	<li>Buy my son or daughter a pair of those sneakers with the wheels on the bottom of them.</li>
	<li>Have a room in my house called the "Living Room" that is essentially a museum room, only used when entertaining or on holidays.</li>
  
</ul>

I'll keep adding to the list as I catch myself saying things.  Maybe someday I'll eat my words, but in the meantime, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.  And, if by chance you are one of said people from my list above, I'm not judging you, that just isn't me.
