One of our friends has a roof deck in Beacon Hill and we've spent a lot of nights up there recently.  She probably has one of the best views in all of Boston.  Last week I remembered to take my camera to take some pics.

My <a href="http://www.powershot.com/powershot2/s200/index.html">Elph</a> came with some software called PhotoStitch that merges photos together to create the panorama (click on the image above). Several interesting things happened that night.  First, a continuous stream of motorcycles drove down Beacon Street.  There was about 100 of them in all and they were all riding  Harleys.  Even from the roof deck, we could hear the noise.

Next, about 10 Chinese kids came up to drink tea and eat cake.  Nothing too unusual about that right?  I didn't think so either until they started taking pictures of themselves with the cake.  As it turns out, it was the <a href="http://www.chinesefortunecalendar.com/midfallstory.htm">Chinese Moon Festival</a> and they were eating moon cakes.
