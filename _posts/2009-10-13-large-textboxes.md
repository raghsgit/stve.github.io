title: Large Textboxes
---
Something I've seen on a [few](http://gemcutter.org) [sites](http://animoto.com) lately is really large textboxes on signup/sign in forms.  I'm not sure how I feel about them.  In most cases, sites have used this fairly effectively with only a few fields requiring entry.  But when I'm on my 13" Macbook Pro, I have to scroll to see the submit button at the bottom.

The other thing that large textboxes does is eliminate other possibilities for these pages, like [using the sign up form as a qualifier](http://bokardo.com/archives/using-your-sign-up-form-as-a-qualifier/).  [Joshua Porter](http://bokardo.com), the author of that article also recently gave a [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/bokardo/designing-for-social-traction) that has really inspired me lately.  Highly recommended.
