<em>Continuing on with lists.  I know these are lame blog posts, but it's helping me get my writing ability back, and it's also basically all that I have time for at the moment.</em>

In no particular order (an * denotes that I've seen them multiple times).  For the most part I've excluded opening acts unless they were noteworthy.  I'm also excluding some bands I might have seen at festivals like the Horde Festival or Lollapalooza.

Blues Traveler*
Dave Matthews Band*
David Gray*
George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars
Sonic Youth*

I'm sure that I'm missing quite a few shows that I've seen but this is all I can remember right now.  If you didn't figure it out, I meandered through various musical tastes along the way that started with a slightly hippie-esque following (BT, DMB, Phish, etc.), transitioned into grunge, then a random whatever was at my college at the time period,  followed by a trance phase, and then settling into pattern of rarely seeing shows and when I did they'd be something I really wanted to see (Coldplay, Wynton Marsalis, Bjork, et. al.).

<strong>Bands I'd love to see live</strong>

The Stone Roses
Pink Floyd
Radiohead (this one might actually happen someday as the others on this list are no-longer together)
