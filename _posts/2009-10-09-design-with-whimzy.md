I'm a wine drinker so I was naturally curious to check out one of <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary Vaynerchuk's</a> new ventures: <a href="http://cinderellawine.com/">Cinderella Wine</a>.  The concept is simple, one wine is sold a day starting at midnight and the sale continues (often heavily discounted) until it's sold out.  One thing I really like about the site's design is what happens when the wine sells out, the photo of the wine bottle is replaced by a pumpkin.

It fits the site's namesake perfectly and adds an air of whimzy that I'd love to see a bit more of.
