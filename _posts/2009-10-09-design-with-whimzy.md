title: Design with Whimzy
---

I'm a wine drinker so I was naturally curious to check out one of [Gary Vaynerchuk's](http://garyvaynerchuk.com/) new ventures: [Cinderella Wine](http://cinderellawine.com/).  The concept is simple, one wine is sold a day starting at midnight and the sale continues (often heavily discounted) until it's sold out.  One thing I really like about the site's design is what happens when the wine sells out, the photo of the wine bottle is replaced by a pumpkin.

It fits the site's namesake perfectly and adds an air of whimzy that I'd love to see a bit more of.
