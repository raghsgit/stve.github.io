<p>Uh, I guess I like duality in my blog titles.</p>
<p>What an odd weekend that was.  We're heading out on a two week vacation later in the month so this was a weekend where we planned on taking it easy to save some money.</p>
<p>On Friday night we enjoyed a nice dinner out at one of our favorite Pizza spots.  Was friday night your pizza night too?  What is it about Friday nights and pizza that just go together?  My pizza spots over the years: Village Pizza, then Angelos Pizzeria II, in Boston we didn't really have one, down here it's Faccia Luna or Italian Store.  Actually it's both.  Faccia Luna when we want to go in and sit down for dinner, Italian Store for pickup.  Friday night's choice was Faccia Luna.</p>
<p>Saturday was just a lazy day.  There were things to do but we never really got going.  It was a great day to stay inside anyway.  The weather right now is just flat out oppressive.  It's incredibly humid, and on Saturday that was paired with several thunderstorms.  We started the day by watching the last hour or so of The Aviator that we had begun watching the night before.  Great movie.  I was going to run out in the afternoon but the Yankees/Red Sox game was on and that destroyed any chance of my actually getting my ass off the couch.</p>
<p>The downside to a lazy Saturday was leaving everything for Sunday.  We were able to come up with an extremely large todolist and go to it.  Stops at the bank, golf store, Crate & Barrel, Ikea, Christine's office.  We got home at almost 11pm.</p>
<p>And now the week begins...
