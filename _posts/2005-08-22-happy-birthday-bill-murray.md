Hmm. So yesterday wasn't <a title="Bill Murray" href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000195/">Bill Murray's</a> birthday afterall. I could have sworn that it was after The Man Who Knew Too Little (a BIG fave), Rushmore, Kingpin and Lost in Translation were all on Encore yesterday. A very enjoyable day for me, as all 4 movies are high on my list. I noticed that Groundhog Day was also on earlier (another BIG fave). Bill Murray's birthday is actually September 21st, were they off by a month?

Did they realize that on Saturday night I watched Life Aquatic? <a href="http://www.encoretv.com">Encore</a>, what gives? Was that a ploy to make you my favorite channel?
