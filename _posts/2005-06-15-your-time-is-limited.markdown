<p>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life," Jobs said. "Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice."</p>
<p>I hope that resonated with <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/grad-061505.html">them</a>.</p>
<p>I can't help but feel the same way lately.  With a busy schedule (all good stuff, mind you), I find that I rarely feel fully satisfied anymore.  There's all this reading, painting, thinking, writing that I'd like to do.  But never enough time, not enough space.</p>
<p>I guess that's what these graduates don't know yet.  How this hustle and bustle just seizes you.</p>
<p>On a good note, we just made our reservations for vacation: 2 weeks on the west coast in LA, San Francisco, Napa Valley and Seattle.  Maybe what I need is a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here is the <a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=1136852">full speech</a> and <a href="http://www.wiredatom.com/jobs_stanford_speech/index.html">audio</a>.
