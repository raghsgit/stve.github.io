Taken while I was in NYC this past September.  I've been very busy working on a CMS system for <a href="http://www.orangeapple.com">orangeapple</a>, I haven't really had much time to focus on this poor website of mine.

<p class="photo"><img width="510" height="327" alt="Variety" src="/_images/variety.jpg" /></p>
<p class="photo"><img width="510" height="277" alt="GEM GEM" src="/_images/gem.jpg" /></p>
Not the greatest shots in the world, but I couldn't keep pretending that the Super Bowl was yesterday!.
