It's amazing what a day out in public will do.  Here's a few more <a href="http://www.beforeitwasround.com/2007/05/16/never-say-never/" title="Never Say Never">nevers</a> to add to the list:

<ul>
	<li>Tucking a t-shirt into pants or shorts.</li>
	<li>Wearing a cell phone (or any device for that matter) on a belt clip.</li>
	<li>Wearing any sort of fanny-pack for touring reasons.  Waist-packs for camping or hiking are still acceptable.</li>
	<li>Unless riding a bike, biking shorts are not to be worn at any time.</li>
	<li>Wearing fluorescent colored anything.</li>
</ul>

I get the feeling this is going to become a frequent blot post as there are just way too many tasteless things in the world.
