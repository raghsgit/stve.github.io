Ok, so this video is pretty lame, but I absolutely love this song off the new <a href="http://www.jazzanova.net">Jazzanova</a> album.  That's <a href="http://www.myspace.com/prandolph">Paul Randolph</a> on the vocals whom I first heard on the <a href="http://www.sonarkollektiv.com/artists/ISoul8/">Isoul8</a> album (which I also really like).

I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Things-Jazzanova/dp/B001FBJTYQ">Of All The Things</a>.  I can see how it turned off some Jazzanova fans that were looking for a sound more in line with their debut album, In Between.  Others will point to the throwback style similar to that of 4Hero's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Play-Changes-4hero/dp/B000MGBTHK/">Play With The Changes</a>.  For me, it is a wonderful album, and with guests like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/josejamesquartet">Jose James</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/benwestbeech">Ben Westbeech</a>, <a href="http://www.leonware.com/">Leon Ware</a>, and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/littlebrother">Phonte</a>, I can't wait to hear what Jazzanova cooks up next.
