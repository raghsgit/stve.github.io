I'm really late on this.  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/josejamesquartet">Jose James</a> album, The Dreamer, has been out for a long time now, but I've only recently ordered it.  I can't wait for it to arrive.  If you haven't checked him out, here's a taste:

This album, plus the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LU7uPcLufg">new one from Jazzanova</a>, are the only exceptions I've made to myself during this self imposed music spending diet.  I usually buy on average, about an album a week, and I've assembled quite a large collection.  Anyone who knows me knows that I can be music obsessed.

Right after Labor Day, I vowed to cut back, at least temporarily.  It's been a great way for me to revisit some of the things I haven't listened to as much of late, and it's also been a great test of self control.  And so far, so good.  I haven't really been tempted to pick something up and the lust I've had for a few things on my wish-list has been tempered as well.  The spending diet was to continue through Thanksgiving but I may test myself and see if I can last until the end of the year.
