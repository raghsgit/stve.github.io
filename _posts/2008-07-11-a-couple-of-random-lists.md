<strong>Movies I've Seen this year (and mini reviews to go with them)</strong>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://coolspotters.com/movies/juno">Juno</a> - entertaining but a little too snarky for my liking
	<li><a href="http://coolspotters.com/movies/cloverfield">Cloverfield</a> - loved the action and fast pace but gave me motion sickness</li>
	<li>Smart People - totally sucked - just like I figured it would</li>
	<li><a href="http://coolspotters.com/movies/made-of-honor">Made of Honor</a> - watch you'd expect it to be, a total chick-flick, light and fluffy, guy gets girl, predictable but worth it for getting kudos with the wife.</li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, I haven't seen many movies this year and haven't really liked any of the ones I've seen so far.  I am looking forward to seeing <a href="http://coolspotters.com/movies/the-dark-knight">The Dark Knight</a> and <a href="http://coolspotters.com/movies/wall-e">Wall-E</a>.  I'm not a huge superhero fan so Iron Man and Hulk don't really interest me.  Batman Begins was a recent favorite of mine so I have high hopes for The Dark Knight.  As for what else is due this year, <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/thecuriouscaseofbenjaminbutton/">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/righteouskill/">Righteous Kill</a> look worth seeing.  I'll pretty much watch any movie that has both Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro in it.  If there's a new Harry Potter movie this year, I'd like to see that as well.</p>

<strong>Music I've bought and liked recently</strong>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://coolspotters.com/albums/viva-la-vida-or-death-and-all-his-friends">Viva la Vida</a></li>
	<li>a couple of early Cafe Del Mar compilations - I got hooked on volume 5 and picked up a few more along the way.  The newer ones aren't all that great, in fact, the whole series went downhill after Jose Padilla stopped compiling them.  But they are great for relaxing to and especially with a baby at home, we find them indispensable around bedtime.  I had volumes 3, 5, 6 and 7, so I back filled with volumes 1, 2 and 4.  Volume 1 has a very raw sound reminiscent of electronic music from the mid-late 90's but both 2 and 4 are really great!</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ellington-At-Newport-1956-Duke/dp/B00000IMYA">Ellington Live at Newport 1956</a> - absolutely wonderful</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014DBZTM">Cinematic Orchestra - Live at Royal Albert Hall</a> - Having purchased <a href="http://www.concertlive.co.uk/Live%20CDs/TheCinematicOrchestra.aspx">previous live albums</a> by them, I knew this would be good, and sure enough, it is!</li>
</ul>
