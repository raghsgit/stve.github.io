title: Twitter Trends on Brizzly
---

I've been using [Brizzly](http://brizzly.com) almost exclusively as my twitter client lately on the desktop.  It's not perfect, but compared to twitter.com, I really enjoy the additional features and attention to detail that was put into it.  One of the things I really like is the way they annotate the twitter trends.  Twitter does this too - using [What the Trend?](http://whatthetrend.com/) to provide their descriptions.  What's cool about Brizzly is that it invites it's users to help out:

I've found that I pay a lot more attention to Twitter trends this way.  Twitter has become my go-to for what's happening with the things I'm interested in.  It's most fun to check out during Yankees games these days - I hope that doesn't change for a few more weeks!  Go Yankees!

Also, for Twitter on the go, check out [Tweetie 2](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/), it's awesome.
