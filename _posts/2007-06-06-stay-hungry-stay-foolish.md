I'm quite busy at the moment but I'm attempting to keep things rolling along here.  Here are a few other things that I've enjoyed and noticed lately:

People sure do <a href="http://www.tweetvolume.com/index.php?search_phrases=twitter,google,apple,yahoo,microsoft">twitter a lot about twitter</a>, don't they?  <a href="http://www.tweetvolume.com">TweetVolume</a> is a neat little site.

This video of a <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c35_1178938654">camera on a Tokyo Sushi Bar conveyor belt</a> is loads of fun to watch.

Really neat information visualization of data from <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> on <a href="http://lastgraph.aeracode.org/">Last Graph</a>, here's <a href="/_misc/lastfm.pdf">what I've listened to</a> over the past year and a half or so.

<a href="http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/release.php?id=1240">Ma Fleur</a>, the new album from <a href="http://www.cinematicorchestra.com/">The Cinematic Orchestra</a>, is truly beautiful work.
