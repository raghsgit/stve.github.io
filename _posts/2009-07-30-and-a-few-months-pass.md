Well, this blog had a good run for a while.  I was posting links to new music I was digging and then all of a sudden it ground to a screeching halt again.  What gives?  Well, things got a little hectic around here for a bit.  We undertook a home renovation project, I started working on a new project at work among a few other things I won't get into here.  Most of this summer has been spent scurrying here and there in between the chaos.

But now that August rolls around, it's time to slow things down a bit.  Entourage is finally back on and it won't be long before football kicks off and playoff baseball (Go Yankees!).

It's a good time to reflect a bit.  It's also a good time to laugh at these awesome Dos Equis ads!
