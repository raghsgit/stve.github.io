Ok, so.  Quick update on where I'm at.  As you can tell, things are a little messy around here.  I've moved from Tilted to Textdrive and I'm also moving from MovableType to Wordpress.  My hacked up MT install was just too finicky for me to do anything with and after a while became a total pain.  Things will be in disrepair until I can port my archives and dress up this wordpress blog.  In the meantime, please standby...
