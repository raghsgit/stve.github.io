Well that was quite a hiatus wasn't it?  I got pulled onto a huge train wreck of a project at work back in October and we just launched last week.  I spent a good majority of the last couple of months traveling back and forth between New Jersey and Boston.

I've also been dealing with the lack of a home computer since early October when I mistakenly fried the motherboard while adding more RAM.  It's still not fixed. (note to Dell tech support - you guys suck!)

Some of the highlights over the past couple of months (in no particular order):
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.generationjets.com">Generation Jets</a> - a website made by orangeapple</li>
	<li>Watching <a href="http://www.lost-in-translation.com/">Lost in Translation</a></li>
	<li>Dressing up as <a href="http://www.allmoviephoto.com/photo/will_ferrell_zoolander_003.html">Jacobim Mugatu</a> for Halloween (photos coming)</li>
	<li>Reading the <a href="http://pi.canongate.net/life_of_pi.htm">Life of Pi</a> by Yann Martel</li>
	<li>Attending several weddings</li>
	<li>Having a holiday party in the blizzard</li>
	<li>Having a house in <a href="http://www.picomountain.com">Vermont</a> for the winter</li>
	<li>Having the <a href="http://www.marsvolta.net">Mars Volta</a> to keep me going while pulling several very late nights at work</li>
</ul>
If you've been checking on this site once in a while for updates, my apologies for leaving you in the dark.  Hopefully it won't happen again.  I'm excited for the new year and all it has to offer.
