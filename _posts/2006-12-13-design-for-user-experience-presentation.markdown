I gave a presentation at work centered around User Experience.  The presentation was aimed at those who don't have a lot of knowledge around what UX is and was meant to be humourous but also insightful.  I got a lot of great feedback on it and our keynote speaker, <a href="http://www.davidgoldsmith.com/">David Goldsmith</a> actually cited me in a quote the following day when he gave his presentation.  I am quite humbled by that.

I owe a great amount of gratitude for some of the ideas in the presentation to <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37Signals</a>, particularly the Less is Less slide.  In addition, many of the images in the presentation were taken from <a title="This Is Broken" href="http://www.thisisbroken.com/">This Is Broken</a>.
