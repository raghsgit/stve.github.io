This weekend, in search of something new to do, we decided to go to the <a href="http://www.hob.com/venues/clubvenues/cambridge/">House of Blues</a> in Harvard Square.  I had never been, even though I've probably walked by it a hundred times.

The place isn't very big, but it's a great place to catch a show.  We saw two reggae bands perform.  The first band, <a href="http://www.mangdub.com">Mang Dub</a> played a nice set of dub.  They were a full 7 piece band with two saxophone players and another member played this instrument that I'd never seen before.  It looked like a keyboard with a mouthpiece attached to it.  We joked that it was an electric bagpipe.

Next up was <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/130/vibewise.html">Vibewise</a>.  They really got the crowd into it.  Their lead singer had great stage presence, the whole place was moving.  They had a lot of guests come up on stage and that really added a new dimension to their set.

Sadly, they've just announced that they are <a href="http://www.hob.com/venues/clubvenues/cambridge/announcement.asp">closing the location</a> and looking for a bigger venue.  I feel so privileged that I got a chance to experience a show there before they close it down.
