I just ate a Jello Pudding Snack with a fork.  Believe it or not, but a fork is an effective way of eating a Jello Pudding Snack.  It's not exactly "lick it clean" clean, but I managed to get most of the pudding out of that little tub.  I didn't have to resort to using my finger.

In fact, for the past month I've eaten yogurt with a fork as well.  Simply put, we've run out of plastic spoons and keep forgetting to buy more.  Yet we continue to buy yogurts and recently puddings but no spoons.  So I bring a fork instead and make do.

For one reason or another my office does not have a plethora of unused plastic utensils.  Isn't that usually a staple of most offices?  We have plenty of three day-old leftover tuna sandwiches sitting in the fridge, but if you are looking for a fork or a spoon, you are shit out of luck.  I don't even bother to look anymore, I know that there's nothing there.  And it's been that way for quite a while.  Earlier this year, I ate baked ziti with my fingers and pad thai with a knife!

Somehow, through this ordeal I've never thought to bring in one of the spoons we have from home.  I'm not really sure why.
