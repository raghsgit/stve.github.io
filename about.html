My name is Steve Agalloco.  I live with my wife and our two children in <del>Washington, DC Avon, CT</del>  Charlotte, NC. I work for a financial services company and I'm not really allow to say much more than that!  I spend most of my day (and many of my nights) working with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>.  If you are into that sort of thing, I have a pretty active profile on <a href="http://github.com/spagalloco">github</a> where I've contributed to a variety of open source projects as well as releasing some of my own creation as well.

I have a passion for music.  Without going into too much detail, check out some radio shows like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/gillespeterson/" title="Gilles Peterson Worldwide">Gilles Peterson Worldwide</a> or <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/benjib/" title="Deviation">Deviation</a> to get an idea for what I'm into.
