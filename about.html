<p>My name is Steve Agalloco.  I live with my wife and our two children in Charlotte, NC. I'm a transplant to the south, by way of a rough path that goes something like this: central New Jersey > Massachusetts > Washington, DC > central New Jersey > Massachusetts > Washington, DC > Connecticut > Charlotte.  Notice the north-south trend there. Were it to continue, I'd probably end up somewhere in Maine, followed by a move to Florida.  We'll see what life has in store for me.</p>

<p>I work for a financial services company and I'm not really allow to say much more than that thanks to regulatory bodies. My office has a putting green out front so fancy that! I spend most of my day (and many of my nights) working with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>.  If you are into that sort of thing, I have a pretty active profile on <a href="https://github.com/spagalloco">github</a> where I've contributed to a variety of open source projects.  I've published as well as releasing some of my own creation as well.</p>

<p>And now for the obligatory, Q &amp; A between myself and (ahem) myself:</p>

<p><strong>How do I pronounce Agalloco?</strong></p>

<p>Uh-gal-uh-co</p>

<p><strong>That's a mouthful.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, and that is not a question.</p>

<p><strong>Are you seeking employment?</strong></p>

<p>No, not at the moment.  Though I am always interested in talking to people.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get in touch with you?</strong></p>

<p>The easiest way to get in touch with me is by email at <a
