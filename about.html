<p>My name is Steve Agalloco.  I live with my wife and our two children in Charlotte, NC. I'm a transplant to the south, by way of a path that goes something like this: central New Jersey > Massachusetts > Washington, DC > central New Jersey > Massachusetts > Washington, DC > Connecticut > Charlotte.  Notice the north-south trend there. Were it to continue, I'd probably end up somewhere in Maine, followed by a move to Florida.  We'll see what life has in store.</p>

<p>I work for a financial services company and I'm not really allow to say much more than that thanks to regulatory bodies. My office has a putting green out front so fancy that! I spend most of my day (and many of my nights) working with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>.  Previously, I've worked from Fortune 100 companies all the way down to 5 person startups. If you are into that sort of thing, I have a pretty active profile on <a href="https://github.com/spagalloco">github</a> where I've contributed to and created a variety of open source projects.</p>

<p>Outside of software, I enjoy spending time with my family, golfing when I have a chance, red wine, and the occasional single malt scotch.</p>

<p>And now for the obligatory, Q &amp; A between myself and (ahem) myself:</p>

<p><strong>How do I pronounce Agalloco?</strong></p>

<p>Uh-gal-uh-co</p>

<p><strong>That's a mouthful.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, and that is not a question.</p>

<p><strong>Are you seeking employment?</strong></p>

<p>No, not at the moment.  Though I am always interested in talking to people.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get in touch with you?</strong></p>

<p>The easiest way to get in touch with me is by email at <a
href="mailto:s&#116;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#46;ag&#97;l&#108;&#111;&#99;o&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;i&#108;.&#99;o&#109;">&#115;&#116;&#101;&#118;&#101;.&#97;&#103;&#97;&#108;loc&#111;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What does beforeitwaround mean?</strong></p>

<p>Before it was round is a reference to the world pre-Christopher Columbus and the paradigm shift that took place afterwards. Prior to Columbus' discovery of North America, the earth was flat because we believed it to be. Hence: the earth was flat before it was round. I've always enjoyed thinking of things that way. That something is one thing, until something happens and then it isn't anymore. It's a simple way of thinking of the world (and yes, I'm aware that the Vikings likely discovered america well before Columbus).  Did you know that Columbus kept <a href="http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/columbus.htm">two logs of the journey</a>?  One with the actual distance calculated, and another to share with his crew. Fascinating.</p>
