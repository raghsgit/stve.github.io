<p>My name is Steve Agalloco.  I live with my wife and our two children in <del>Washington, DC Avon, CT</del>  Charlotte, NC. I work for a financial services company and I'm not really allow to say much more than that!  I spend most of my day (and many of my nights) working with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>.  If you are into that sort of thing, I have a pretty active profile on <a href="http://github.com/spagalloco">github</a> where I've contributed to a variety of open source projects as well as releasing some of my own creation as well.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get in touch with me is by email at <a
