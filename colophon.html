<p>The site's design is my own, with some help (ok, a lot of help) from <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm's</a> <a href="http://pea.rs/">Pears pattern library</a>.  The color palette is one designed called <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/2059746/Soaked">Soaked</a>.

<p>So why did it take me so long to relaunch it? Truth be told, I worked on this site off and on over the span of several months.  I used this as an opportunity to learn about Compass and Sass, dabble in CoffeeScript, as well as migrate the whole thing off of a self-hosted WordPress installation.  I also really wanted the site to look good both visually and in the code.  Along the way, I worked on <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/guard-jekyll">guard-jekyll</a> and fiddled with all sorts of things, including: <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>, <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">h5bp</a>, among others.
